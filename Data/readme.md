This folder contains sub-directories for the Phase 1a and 1b experiments within the 1st Phase of CalLMIP.

It also contains the general (not site specific) forcing files needed for site-scale simulations and calibrations. Specifically, atmospheric CO2 and N deposition forcing data for historical/transient, runs prior to the calibration, time window will be provided in the coming days (November 24th 2025). 

Forcing files for each site can be obtained from modelevaluation.org. See the Phase 1 protocol for further details.

The flux observation files can be found in sub-directories in this Data directory. Note in Phase1a-test there is only one file for the DK-Sor test site.
